## Domain Model

### Introduction

The **Domain Model** design pattern is employed in this project to organize business logic by creating a representation of the core concepts and their relationships within the application's domain. Unlike the Transaction Script pattern, the Domain Model focuses on modeling entities, behaviors, and their interactions.

### Key Concepts

1. **Rich Entities:**
   - Entities are enriched with behavior, encapsulating both data and operations.

2. **Ubiquitous Language:**
   - Uses a common vocabulary shared between developers and domain experts.

3. **Protection of Invariants:**
   - Emphasizes the protection of invariants to ensure the consistency and integrity of the domain model.

4. **Complex Business Logic:**
   - Ideal for complex business rules and intricate relationships between entities.

### Why Domain Model?

1. **Complex Business Rules:**
   - Suitable for applications with complex business rules and intricate entity relationships.

2. **Encapsulation of Behavior:**
   - Entities encapsulate both data and behavior, leading to a more cohesive and encapsulated design.

3. **Ubiquitous Language Adoption:**
   - Promotes the adoption of a common language, fostering better communication between developers and stakeholders.

## Usage Guidelines

To effectively use the Domain Model pattern, consider the following:

1. **Identify Core Entities:**
   - Identify the fundamental entities within the application domain.

2. **Define Relationships:**
   - Clearly define the relationships between entities, capturing the intricacies of the domain.

3. **Protect Invariants:**
   - Enforce mechanisms to protect invariants, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the domain model.

4. **Adopt Ubiquitous Language:**
   - Ensure that the codebase reflects the terminology used by domain experts.

5. **Encapsulation of Behavior:**
   - Ensure that entities encapsulate both data and behavior, promoting a more cohesive design.

## Differences from Transaction Script

1. **Representation of Business Logic:**
   - *Domain Model:* Distributed across rich entities.
   - *Transaction Script:* Centralized within scripts.

2. **Simplicity vs. Complexity:**
   - *Domain Model:* Ideal for complex business rules.
   - *Transaction Script:* Suitable for straightforward logic.

3. **Use of Language:**
   - *Domain Model:* Emphasizes a ubiquitous language.
   - *Transaction Script:* Focuses on procedural code.

4. **Entity Enrichment:**
   - *Domain Model:* Entities are enriched with behavior.
   - *Transaction Script:* Entities are often simple data structures.

Choose the Domain Model pattern based on the nature and complexity of your application's business logic, with special attention to the protection of invariants for ensuring data consistency.
