# Service Layer

## Introduction

The **Service Layer** is a crucial architectural component in our software application. It encapsulates the business logic, providing a set of services that can be invoked by different parts of the system. This README provides an overview of the Service Layer and its importance.

## Why is the Service Layer Important?

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - The Service Layer facilitates a clean separation of concerns by isolating business logic from other components. This promotes maintainability and modularity in the codebase.

2. **Reusability and Composition:**
   - Services within the Service Layer can leverage and compose business logic, allowing for the reuse of code and the creation of more complex functionalities.

3. **Abstraction of Operations:**
   - The Service Layer abstracts away the implementation details of specific operations, providing a high-level interface for the rest of the application to interact with.
