# Registry Pattern

## Introduction

The **Registry** pattern is a design pattern that provides a centralized and organized mechanism for managing and storing objects, components, or services within an application. It acts as a centralized repository, facilitating easy access, retrieval, and management of instances.

## Why is the Registry Pattern Important?

### 1. Centralized Management

The Registry pattern centralizes the management of objects, components, or services. This centralized approach simplifies the overall architecture and promotes a single point of control for instantiation and retrieval.

### 2. Easy Access and Retrieval

By using a registry, developers can easily access and retrieve instances of objects without the need for complex instantiation logic scattered throughout the codebase. This simplifies code and enhances readability.

### 3. Configurability and Extensibility

Registries often provide a configurable and extensible mechanism. This allows developers to customize the behavior of the registry, making it adaptable to changing requirements and supporting different use cases.

### 4. Dependency Injection

The Registry pattern can be employed as part of a dependency injection mechanism, facilitating the injection of dependencies into components or services. This enhances the modularity and testability of the application.
