## Specification Pattern

### Introduction

The **Specification** pattern, as described by Martin Fowler, is a design pattern that enables the definition of business rules in a declarative manner. It provides a way to encapsulate conditions and criteria for selecting objects, making the rules reusable and composable.

### Why is the Specification Pattern Important?

1. **Declarative Business Rules:**
   - The Specification pattern allows developers to express business rules in a declarative and readable form. This enhances the understandability of the code and facilitates collaboration with domain experts.

2. **Reusable and Composable Conditions:**
   - Specifications encapsulate conditions that can be reused across different parts of the application. They can also be combined to create more complex rules, promoting code modularity and maintainability.

3. **Encapsulation of Logic:**
   - By encapsulating criteria in specifications, the pattern helps in separating business logic from the rest of the application. This results in cleaner and more maintainable code.

4. **Flexible Querying:**
   - Specifications can be used to construct queries dynamically. This flexibility is particularly useful in scenarios where the criteria for selecting objects may change at runtime.
