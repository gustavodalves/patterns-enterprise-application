# Project Transaction Script

## Introduction

The **Transaction Script** is a design pattern used in this project to organize business logic by grouping related operations into individual scripts. Each script, known as a transaction script, represents a single transaction or unit of work in the application. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where the business logic is straightforward and can be directly mapped to individual transactions.

## Key Concepts

1. **Script as a Transaction:**
   - In the Transaction Script pattern, a script corresponds to a transaction or a single action within the system. These scripts encapsulate the logic needed to perform a specific operation.

2. **Procedural Style:**
   - The pattern often follows a procedural programming style. Each script consists of a series of steps or procedures that are executed sequentially to accomplish the desired task.

3. **Centralized Logic:**
   - Business logic is often centralized within these transaction scripts. This can make it easier to manage and maintain, especially in systems where the business rules are relatively simple.

## Why is the Transaction Script Pattern Important?

1. **Simplicity:**
   - Well-suited for scenarios where the business logic is straightforward and doesn't involve complex interactions or workflows.

2. **Ease of Maintenance:**
   - Centralized scripts make it easier to locate, update, and maintain specific pieces of business logic without navigating through a more complex architecture.

3. **Clear Transaction Boundaries:**
   - Each script corresponds to a clear transaction or operation, helping to define and understand the boundaries of individual actions within the system.

## Usage

To effectively use the Transaction Script pattern, consider the following:

1. **Identify Transactions:**
   - Identify and define transactions or operations that can be encapsulated into individual scripts.

2. **Create Transaction Scripts:**
   - Implement transaction scripts as procedural code that performs the necessary steps to complete a specific task.

3. **Avoid Overhead:**
   - Use this pattern in scenarios where the overhead of a more complex architecture, such as a domain model, is unnecessary.

4. **Separate Concerns:**
   - If necessary, separate concerns within scripts, but maintain the overall simplicity of the pattern.
