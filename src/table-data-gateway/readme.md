# Table Data Gateway

## Introduction

The **Table Data Gateway** is a design pattern employed in this project to manage the interaction between the application and specific database tables. It encapsulates the data access logic for a particular table, providing a gateway for performing CRUD operations in a clean and organized manner.

## Key Concepts

1. **Database Table Representation:**
   - The Table Data Gateway focuses on representing and interacting with a specific database table.

2. **Data Access Logic:**
   - Encapsulates database-specific logic for CRUD operations related to the associated table.

3. **Table Gateway Interface:**
   - Provides a high-level interface for the application to interact with the database table.

## Similarity with DAO (Data Access Object)

The Table Data Gateway pattern shares similarities with the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. Both patterns involve abstracting data access logic, but there are subtle differences:

1. **Scope:**
   - Table Data Gateway is specific to a single database table, while DAO may handle data access for multiple entities or tables.

2. **API Design:**
   - Table Data Gateway's API is closely tied to the structure and operations of a specific table.

3. **Granularity:**
   - Table Data Gateway has a finer granularity, dealing with operations on individual tables, whereas DAO may have a broader scope.

## Why is the Table Data Gateway Pattern Important?

1. **Encapsulation:**
   - Encapsulates database access logic, ensuring separation between application code and database details.

2. **Single Responsibility:**
   - Each Table Data Gateway focuses on the CRUD operations of a specific table, adhering to the single responsibility principle.

3. **Centralized Maintenance:**
   - Centralizes the maintenance of database access logic, making updates and changes more manageable.

## Usage

To effectively use the Table Data Gateway pattern:

1. **Create Table Data Gateway Classes:**
   - For each database table, create a corresponding Table Data Gateway class.

2. **Define High-Level API:**
   - Design a high-level API for each Table Data Gateway class, providing methods for common CRUD operations.

3. **Isolate Database Logic:**
   - Isolate and encapsulate all database-specific logic within the Table Data Gateway.

4. **Use in Application Code:**
   - In application code, use the Table Data Gateway classes to perform data access operations on the associated database tables.
