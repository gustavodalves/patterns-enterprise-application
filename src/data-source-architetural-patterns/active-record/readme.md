# Active Record

## Introduction

The **Active Record** is a design pattern used in this project to encapsulate both data access logic and business logic within a single class. It represents a record in the database as an object in the application code, providing a convenient and intuitive way to interact with the database.

## Key Concepts

1. **Database Record Representation:**
   - An Active Record class represents a specific record in the database. Each instance of the class corresponds to a row in the associated database table.

2. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Active Record provides methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the underlying database record.

3. **Data Validation:**
   - It often includes validation methods to ensure that data is valid before persisting it to the database.

## Similarity with Other Patterns

### Similarity with Table Data Gateway

1. **Data Access Logic:**
   - Like Table Data Gateway, Active Record encapsulates data access logic. However, Active Record integrates this logic into the record representation itself.

2. **Single Record Focus:**
   - Both patterns focus on individual records, with Active Record being specific to a single record and Table Data Gateway to a single table.

### Similarity with DAO

1. **Data Access Abstraction:**
   - Active Record, like DAO, abstracts the data access logic, but it does so within the context of a specific record rather than a more generic interface.

2. **Object-Relational Mapping:**
   - Both patterns involve some form of object-relational mapping, but Active Record often provides a more direct mapping by representing database records as objects.

## Why is the Active Record Pattern Important?

1. **Simplicity and Intuitiveness:**
   - Active Record simplifies data access by representing records as objects, making it more intuitive for developers.

2. **Code Organization:**
   - Combining data access and business logic in a single class improves code organization and maintainability.

3. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):**
   - Active Record provides a form of ORM, making it easier to work with databases without dealing with raw SQL queries.

## Usage

To effectively use the Active Record pattern:

1. **Create Active Record Classes:**
   - Create a class for each database table you want to interact with, extending the Active Record base class.

2. **Define Data Validation:**
   - Implement data validation methods within the Active Record classes to ensure data integrity.

3. **Use CRUD Operations:**
   - Utilize the provided CRUD methods to interact with the database records directly from the Active Record instances.
